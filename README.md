# Assistive Robotics: Pepper and TurtleBot Studies for Claudia

## Overview

This repository contains research summaries on assistive robotics focusing on the Pepper and TurtleBot robots. The studies explore how these robots can enhance social engagement and mobility assistance for individuals with specific needs, like Claudia.

## Key Insights

1. **Social and Emotional Support with Pepper:** Pepper significantly improves mental health and social well-being by providing companionship, facilitating conversations, and assisting with daily tasks.
2. **Mobility and Independence with TurtleBot:** TurtleBot aids individuals with mobility impairments, enhancing independence through reliable indoor navigation, tested extensively in ROS simulations.

## Case Study: Claudia

Claudia is a 54-year-old residing alone and facing significant challenges due to severe glaucoma and diabetes. She is partially sighted, with her visual impairment primarily caused by glaucomaâ€”a condition characterized by increased fluid pressure in the eye leading to optic nerve damage. This condition has progressively diminished her vision, undermining her confidence and restricting her mobility.

### Challenges

- **Visual Impairment:** Severe glaucoma has significantly reduced her vision.
- **Mobility Issues:** Diabetes-related circulatory issues and a recent fall have exacerbated her physical frailty.
- **Isolation:** Geographical distance from her daughter in Australia intensifies her loneliness.
- **Daily Tasks:** Difficulty in locating everyday objects due to visual impairment.

### Assistive Solutions

- **Pepper Robot:** Can provide companionship, reminders for medication, and assist with locating objects using voice commands and interactive prompts. Pepper's interactive capabilities can help reduce loneliness and enhance social engagement.
- **TurtleBot:** Can help navigate her home, enhancing her mobility and ensuring safe movement, especially in avoiding obstacles and reducing fall risks.

Claudia falls into Category 4 (Vulnerable) on the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), marked by her severe glaucoma and diabetes, leading to partial sight loss and decreased physical stability. Her recent fall indicates declining strength and increased need for assistive support.
